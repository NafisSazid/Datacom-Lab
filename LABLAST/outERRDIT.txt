    Sly Fox was n$w running$for hi$ life, but $he dogs were$getting closer 
and closer. He jumped across the brook and$spied a hole among some bu$hes. 
Into this he slid, and as the dogs went down the side of the str$am of water 
before they ju$ped$ac$oss they lost his scent$ Sly Fox quickly ran out of$
the $ole and took off in the opposite direction from the way the $ogs were 
going. He had been so frightened and so$near death that he resolved to 
himself never to bother t$e Rabbit fam$ly$again.

    Meanwhile, when Papa Rabbit had $eard the hounds sta$t the $hase, he 
turned to Mama Rabbit and crie$, "S$fe at last! Call our little rabs for 
prayers of$thanksgiving and praise to our Father which art in heaven."
